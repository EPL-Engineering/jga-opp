The current waveform is displayed as a thick, black line.&nbsp; Threshold waveform is specified by a dashed line.&nbsp; If a negativity or positivity is selected, it will be indicated by a white square.&nbsp; Negativities are indicated by triangles, positivities as squares.&nbsp; Red is P1/N1, yellow is P2/N2, green is P3/N3, light blue is P4/N4, and dark blue is P5/N5.

The following keybindings are used when processing a waveform series:

**Up/Down arrows --** Select previous/next waveform in the series

**Right/Left arrows --** Move a toggled peak left or right along the waveform.&nbsp; Movement of the peak will "snap" to estimated peaks in the waveform. To adjust the peak in fine increments, hold down the \<em\>shift\</em\> key simultaneously.

**Number keys 1-5** -- Select the corresponding peak on the current waveform.&nbsp; To select N1-5, hold down *shift* while pressing the corresponding number.

**P** -- Toggles waveform polarity. *Do this before any other data processing*.

**I --** Estimates N1-5 for all waveforms.&nbsp; If N1-5 is already estimated, recomputes the estimate.

**U --** Updates guess for corresponding P or N of successive waveforms based on position of currently toggled P or N.

**N** -- Toggles normalized view of waveform.

**\+/- keys** -- Increases/decreases scaling factor of waveform.

**S** -- Saves amplitude and latency of peaks.

**E** -- Exports filtered waveforms.

**Return** -- Set threshold to current waveform.

**T** -- Estimates threshold using the correlation coefficients between responses to adjacent levels.

**W** -- Toggles display of threshold estimation details.

&nbsp;

The appropriate keys will repeat if you hold down the key, which may be useful when navigating through the waveforms or adjusting the location of a peak.
